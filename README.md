# angular-pivot-table-with-custom-search-option
This project demonstrates how to add custom search functionality to the [Syncfusion Angular Pivot Table](https://www.syncfusion.com/angular-components/angular-pivot-table). It uses Pivot Table [label filtering](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/pivotview/filtering#label-filtering) to dynamically filter data based on user input, allowing for a more interactive and user-friendly data analysis experience.
